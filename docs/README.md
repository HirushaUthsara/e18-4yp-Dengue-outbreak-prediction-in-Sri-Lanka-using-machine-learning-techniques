## Abstract
This research focuses on the prediction of dengue fever outbreaks, which have become a significant public health concern in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The study explores the complex and dynamic nature of the disease, considering various factors that influence its spread. By utilizing vector populations, urbanization, climate parameters, and other relevant factors, the research aims to develop effective strategies for early detection and prevention of dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka with the aid of machine learning techniques

## Related works
Here are a few related works we discovered after reviewing various research pages.

### Epidemiological Prediction Using Machine Learning
Machine learning models are increasingly utilized for epidemiological prediction, leveraging historical data to classify future dengue incidence as either high or low. Techniques like Fuzzy Association Rule Mining have been pivotal in extracting intricate relationships from diverse datasets, aiding in forecasting outbreaks in regions like Peru. Such approaches offer valuable insights for public health authorities to implement timely preventive measures.

### Climate-Based Dengue Outbreak Prediction with ML
Studies employing machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines, have demonstrated the efficacy of analyzing climate variables like temperature, humidity, and rainfall in forecasting dengue outbreaks. These models provide timely information for health authorities to proactively implement preventive measures, thus mitigating the impact of dengue outbreaks.

### Temporal Dynamics Analysis for Dengue Prediction
Temporal dynamics analysis involves a multi-stage machine learning approach to dissect the temporal relationship between temperature fluctuations and dengue occurrences. By integrating auto-encoding, data representation, and temporal clustering, these models offer accurate predictions of outbreak trends over time, providing crucial insights for public health planning and resource allocation.

### Mathematical Models for Dengue Incidence Prediction
Machine learning techniques facilitate the development of mathematical models that predict dengue incidence based on weather data and population density. These models offer precise estimates of dengue cases, aiding in resource allocation and proactive public health planning.
